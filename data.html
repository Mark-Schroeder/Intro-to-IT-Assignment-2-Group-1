        <p>If Kalied AI is to progress, then it is crucial that the team analyse the data of technology trends provided by Burning Glass. The data collected in 2018 measures job demand and the required generic skills and IT specific skills employers advertising. To begin, the teams have nominated their ideal jobs that they wish to pursue at the end of graduation, this is to help them navigate their course structure throughout RMIT.t</p>
        <p>The organisation chart below identifies each members nominated ideal job and the area they wish to specialise. Mark wishes to lead a team of developers but may have to increase his experience in his chosen minor before reaching an occupation that high level. Jack, Dom and Yousef are determined to become software engineers, while Gabe is eager to challenge his computer science skills as a technician and Emre is keen to enter the workforce as a systems analyst. </p>

          <h3>The IT Manager</h3>
        </div>
        <p>As the ingenuity and reliance of technology continues to expand the workforce will be in search of more IT Managers (BLS, 2018). Marks desired occupation IT Manager is ranked 10th from the burning glass occupation data, with his steppingstone job, Solutions Architect ranked 1st. Mark wants to solve business problems with technology solutions and manage projects across IT. Managers usually need 5 years + of experience in any role to gain the knowledge, respect and attention of their peers (Indeed Career Guide, n.d.). For Mark to excel as a manager he would need experience leading teams as either a Solution Architect, Technician Lead or possess transferable business management skills. </p>
        <p>IT Managers generic skills typically develop over several years of industry experience, Mark must begin to think big-picture to develop his strategic planning and evolve his communication and composure to address high level. These generic skills will be a result of Mark exploring his IT Manager pathway by learning Business Intelligence Reporting, Project Management and in-demand Programming Languages.</p>

          <h3>The Full-stack Engineers</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Jack and Dom’s end-goal is to apply for a Full-Stack Software Engineering Role. The successful candidate is a subject-matter expert on both front-end and back-end programming and will need 2-4 years’ experience (Coding boot camp, n.d.). Generally, the job is usually split into two roles, client side and server side, suggesting that there is more demand for software engineers (1st), and computer programmers (8th) than full-stack (17th). Depending on the knowledge of the team and the size of the project full-stack responsibilities can be unmanageable if the scale is too large (Bhagat, 2021). For Dom and Jack to reach their goal during their university degree both could transition into either front-end or web development to build their technology portfolio accelerating their journey before tackling Full-Stack. </p>
        <p>Full-Stack engineers are knowledgeable in both client side and server-side programming, their attention to detail and communication must be well developed to be successful in their role. Managing their expertise across many platforms would require high-level organisation skills, this could involve scheduling, version control, documenting, and writing clean code (Bhagat, 2021). The most in-demand IT skills for Dom and Jack to learn from the Burning Glass data are SQL, JavaScript, and Java. Many other programming languages are considered favourable such as .NET, HTML, CSS, Python; these languages have very clean syntax and are considered transferable to other languages. </p>

          <h3>The ML Engineer</h3>
        </div>
        <p>The Burning Glass data from 2018 does not include any job advertisements for Machine Learning Engineers, this could be due to its small attention at the time, but since then society has slowly begun to adopt artificial intelligence concepts (Lazzaro, 2021). Now it’s 2022, machine learning is beginning to boom, and Yousef is determined to minor in this field at university with high hopes to enter the industry before the end of graduation. To put his foot in the door, Yousef will need to become well equipped with mathematical models, including algebra, calculus and graph theory (Gillis, n.d).</p>
        <p>Machine Learning Engineers need to be well versed on data-modelling and evaluation to determine technology requirements, as well as natural processing language theories (NLT) to begin building artificial intelligence systems (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). If NLT connects the interactions between human language and computers, then Yousef will need to utilise his problem-solving skills with his applied mathematical background. /p>

          <h3>The Technician</h3>
        </div>
        <p>The closest occupation to represent Gabe’s job title as a technician is a help desk officer. Ranked 5th, Help Desk Officers are a necessity in medium to large scale organisations due to the increase in technology hardware and software; we are becoming increasingly reliant on technology and not everybody can dedicate their lives to understanding how it works, it will be Gabe’s responsibility to ensure the company’s software and hardware is efficient and reliable (Software Reviews, Opinions, and Tips – DNSstuff, 2021). </p>
        <p>Technicians must learn more than just in-demand computer programming languages, it is their duty to supply the hardware for onboarding users and to troubleshoot any technical problem that may face throughout their employment (Chambers, n.d.). This would require strong problem-solving skills and communication skills to decipher problems and to translate technical jargon to staff. Chamber continues to suggest that high organisation skills are necessary to manage the data of resolved and unresolved tickets because they create opportunities to improve the business.</p>

          <h3>The Systems Analyst</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Long-term companies must build a responsive relationship between legacy systems and the new technology implemented throughout the business (Stackscale, 2020). It is impossible for old and new systems to exist problem free, therefore it is up to the Systems Analyst to diagnose advanced technical problems in production and to resolve user issues. Another key duty is to advise management about system innovations to improve operational efficiencies (roberthalf, 2017). The compounding role of enhancing systems to benefit user experience is why the occupation is in high-demand, ranked job 3rd from the Burning Glass data. </p>
        <p>To keep up with the influx of new and changing systems companies engage System Analysts, who must possess quick learning, teamwork and problem-solving skills (Prospects, 2018). Data analysis and project management are two core components for senior level System Analysts, but entry level must be adept in similar platforms to SAP (Betterteam, n.d.). SAP is a cross-platform software system that communicates to all departments. SAP Systems Analysts are constantly in revolving communication with operations, help desk and development teams to help solve problems cases that are easily understood across all business units.</p>
