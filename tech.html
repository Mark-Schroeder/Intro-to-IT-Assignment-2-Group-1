          <h3><u>Machine Learning</u></h3>
          <h4><b>What does it do?</b></h4>
          <p>State of the art technology in Machine Learning can be broken down into different categories. Categories depend on what sort of tasks are expected to be completed by the algorithm being put into place. For example, AutoML (auto machine learning) aims to give an accessible solution to non-experts looking to work on machine learning projects. Azure Machine Learning studio*1 is an AutoML service developed by Microsoft, a software designed to speed up the process of train, deploy models, and manage MLOps (machine learning operations) for both individuals and teams. According to Enlyft*2, Azure machine learning is adopted by companies with >10,000 employees and >1,000,000,000 US$ in revenue. Auto machine learning may be considered the future of machine learning as machine learning models have become a necessary part of activities concerning both organizations and consumers. Having an accessible solution would help meet the ever-growing demand of businesses to not only create new and efficient models, but also re-calibrate older problems to solve them in a new and more efficient way. MLOps is a procedure to develop reliable and efficient machine learning solutions so they can meet the needs of businesses that can achieve automation of data management on large scales easier and ensures minimal human error. MLOps may be seen incorporated in the near future a lot more when utilizing AutoML software as it would be more geared towards satisfying the needs of a business. </p>
          <p>Machine learning in cybersecurity can have applications such as preventing a problem, mitigating damages done, and detecting compromised software. Software that specializes in detection of malware and viruses can use machine learning to perform their tasks more efficiently by detecting abnormal behaviour. Windows Defender ATP*3 specializes in detecting threats that are already prevalent within a system by using endpoint sensors that are built into Windows 10. Typically, according to the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team*3, human analysts would create heuristics that alert on breach activities based on their expertise. However, an analyst can only consider a limited set of signals whilst machine learning algorithms would consider thousands of signals instead. Based on statistics provided by Microsoft, they found that the machine learning algorithms they incorporate were at least 20% more precise at alerting than their human’s manually crafted heuristics. </p>
          <p>TinyML (tiny machine learning) solves the problem of not being able to make certain IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices embedded system smart where the embedded systems are too small and run-on battery. Machine learning models are not only unfit for placement at the embedded system level, but also require a lot of processing power. The idea is implementing a low energy system, such as sensors or microcontrollers, to perform automated tasks with decreased energy consumption and costs, and no internet connection requirement. Microcontrollers, one of TinyMLs solutions, can shrink deep learning networks to fit into any small hardware system and new machine learning frameworks allow for high-powered AI-IoT devices to perform tasks efficiently. With TinyML, we can expect to see voice interfaces on everything in the future. For example, a fridge letting you know that you need to purchase more groceries or an oven pinging your phone when a cake is done baking. </p>
          <p>Finally, Quantum ML (quantum machine learning), which can be referred to as quantum-enhanced machine learning or quantum-assisted machine learning, is an area of research and development that aims to speed up the execution of classical machine learning algorithms by transitioning them into quantum circuits that use qubits instead of binary bits. These new quantum computing systems will utilize qubits rather than binary bits. The difference between the two is that a regular binary bit has two possible states, either a 1 or 0, whereas a qubit has three possible states, either a 1, 0, or a superposition of those two values – an unknown state considered to be both 1 and 0. The idea is that since qubits aren’t limited to two states, they can hold more information and theoretically give quantum computers the potential to be millions of times more powerful than today’s supercomputers.  </p>
          <p>Singh in ‘How machine learning is changing the world’*4 states, “Machine learning is the future of every business”. The broad implication for all kinds of data entry that previously necessitates human intervention can be completed by machines now, for example, ecological experts using machine learning and AI-enabled sensors to analyze data from thousands of sources to make accurate pollution and weather forecast.  </p>
          <h4><b>What is the likely impact?</b></h4>
          <p>Machine learning has numerous applications in our lives and will impact every industry and most, if not all, people. Machine learning looks to improve all segments including healthcare, education, transportation, entertainment, and a lot more. IoT and cloud computing are implementations of machine learning to create smart objects. Businesses may find value in implementing machine learning as it can study patterns hidden in big data that can introduce businesses to methods which may increase customer satisfaction and revenue. </p>
          <p>Machine learning in data mining, the process of analysing data from a database(s) to create findings, allows for the analysis of data to be automated on much larger quantities and provide actual assumptions that may support decisions. As we enter the digital information age, we can understand that manual analysis of data and interpretation by data analysts is impossible due to the volume of data being generated at a faster rate and thus automation can be considered a requirement if individuals or organizations are to benefit from data analysis. A potential application of this can be studying what marketing strategies might be most effective in different markets and which factors impact results, both positively and negatively, according to the business’ interests – for example, do users react positively when they see more familiar faces on personalized  advertisements, like a friend of family member, for products or services. Furthermore, hospitals can use machine learning to predict illnesses based on age, socioeconomic status, and genetic history. According to Rajeckas*6, pharmacists are at risk of losing their jobs in the coming decades. Pill-dispensing robots and prescription delivery services will be able to do much of the work that pharmacists currently do. However, the threat may not be imminent as Rajeckas*6 proceeds to explain that implementation of million-dollar pharmacist robots is simply costly and is unlikely that it will replace humans in the near future. </p>
          <p>According to George-Parkin*7, jobs requiring less than a bachelor’s degree have more than twice the risk of being automated than occupations that require a college degree. For example, non-degree jobs like packaging machine operator, delivery service driver, and retail salesperson have an average automation potential of 55%. In comparison, jobs that require a degree only have a 24% of being automated. </p>
          <h4><b>How will this affect you?</b></h4>
          <p>AI is being implemented behind the scenes on numerous things that make our everyday life more convenient. Spotify, for example, uses AI to provide users with recommendations based on their listening history through features like the “Discover Weekly Service” that recommends music every Monday.  </p>
          <p>We may begin to see our privacy being breached as individuals. Organizations have little incentive to build privacy protections into their system as data can be used to advance their strategic objectives. However, according to Pearce*8, in recent years major privacy breached have made headlines but companies were never held accountable. This could be due to a lack of regulations being put in place to protect a user’s privacy and limit an organizations collection of data. We should hope that they can find a way to create suitable regulations that can both protect the privacy of users and not stifle the advancements of AI technologies. </p>
          <p>Self-driving car have recently become a reality; however, we may begin to see that the implementation of self-driving cars in the near future becoming not only commonplace, but also a more moral task as machines can perform tasks more effectively than humans. According to Gibson*5, self-driving cars will not only be safer drivers by 2025, but far safer, moreover, they identified that self-driving cars are rapidly improving whereas human drivers are not. According to Gibson in Self-driving, wave of future*5, the idea was for humans to be behind the wheel ready to take control of the vehicle on short notice, however, studies show that it is difficult for people to remain alert and engaged while automated vehicles is driving, therefore it may not be wise to implement until we can fully rely on the self-driving vehicle to be fully automated under all circumstances. </p>

          <h3><u>Natural Language Processing</u></h3>
          <h4><b>What does it do?</b></h4>
          <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) stems from a branch of artificial intelligence, it gives computers the ability to understand the text and spoken words similarly to humans. A combination of both computational linguistics and the human language, along with statistical machine learning has allowed this new technology’s birth. NLP is the driving force behind many language-based computer programs. These include applications that aim to translate text from one language to another or anything that can respond to spoken commands as well as many others.  </p>
          <p>The two largest advancements in the evolution of natural language processing were made in 2017 and 2019. The first considerable development came as a new form of deep learning model called Transformer. This made it possible to parallelize the AI training more efficiently, which resulted in a far more accurate and improved product. A short two years later, another implementation of Transformer was made. Pioneered by Google in 2019, the architecture of Transformer was greatly improved by their Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). After this breakthrough, the depths that NLP could reach were far greater than the average human in many tasks. Now in 2022, there is a fast projected expansion of 20.3% in the next 4 years, and this start-of-the-art technology is looking at one of the greatest futures in the current industry. The future of NLP will heavily rely on the investments of further research within companies such as Google and Facebook.  </p>
          <p>NLP has many prospects and continues to look promising every day. There will most definitely be avenues where we see this technology more accurately begin to not only read but also write articles and other important news.   </p>
          <p>An important utilization of NLP is chatterbots or chatbots, which have changed the way we interact with computers. In its most simple form, a chatterbot is a program that simulates and processes human conversation. It allows humans to interact with the program as if it was communicating with a real person. Ranging from the most basic query with a single-line response, all the way to the very sophisticated digital assistance that we see today. </p>
          <p>Chatterbots were created throughout the era of digitization. Allowing businesses to free up time by setting up a system where an automated list of questions and responses are communicated to the customer. While they can sometimes be quite frustrating and hated by many, they do save time by answering many frequently asked questions or helping to send the caller to their required service.  </p>
          <p>The long term aim of NLP is to control the human-to-machine interaction space, and hopefully to the point where talking to a machine is far easier than talking to a human. With more acquisition of data and information over time, the artificial intelligence and tech surrounding NLP will continue to evolve and become more reliable and impactful. </p>
          <h4><b>What is the likely impact?</b></h4>
          <p>NLP helps companies automate processes that would in turn reduce costs or provide insight into improving business strategies. Answer Rocket, software that organizations could apply to their systems, allows staff members or users to access and view specific publicly available company data with search queries that would include natural language. The idea is to make information regarding the company more accessible for all people when they aren’t limited to data that can’t be accessed because they couldn’t word their search correctly. Furthermore, Parlamind is a system that uses NLP to analyse customer communications and automatically answer queries. Analysis of communication can grant businesses with necessary insight into what practices may be failing and why. Additionally, Netomi, another system that uses NLP, automatically grants resolutions to everyday queries instantaneously of everyday support tickets. This effectively allows a company to increase their workforce without actively increasing its headcount, thus, reducing costs for the company and allowing it to be managed more easily.  </p>
          <p>In contrast, NLP may threaten numerous jobs in multiple industries. Digital Genius, a system that utilizes ML, machine learning, and NLP, assesses common customer service interactions of different businesses to understand their client needs which serve as an example of how a job like a customer service agent may be threatened. For now, Digital Genius can help with queries but will refer to a customer service agent when one is required to handle the call; if software like Digital Genius were to advance further then customer service may become entirely handled by AI (artificial intelligence), thus, rendering customer service agents redundant. According to the World Economic Forum*1, jobs that fall under the financial services profile*3, on average, have a 20.8% share of workers at risk of displacement due to the advancements in technology which is the highest percentage share of workers at risk of displacement amongst all the industry profiles*2 mentioned in the text where the mining and metals profile*4 is second with a 19.9% average share of workers at risk of displacement. Customer service workers are categorized into the profile of the financial services making them, on average, threatened by technology the most when compared to others. </p>
          <p>We are likely to see businesses able to implement solutions according to customer needs and client requirements as data can be gathered and analysed based on customer interactions with the company by utilizing ML and NLP. Although some people will lose their jobs, companies will theoretically be able to place more funds into research and development, quality assurance, production, and more factors that may make their goods and services more affordable and accessible. </p>
          <h4><b>How will this affect you?</b></h4>
          <p>NLP, natural language processing, can affect us in many different aspects of life, whether for convenience or support – both emotionally and physically. NLP allows users to translate text from or to any language they desire which has numerous applications. Users may find themselves looking into taking a holiday to a foreign country to experience something new; where in the past they may have been limited by a language barrier, we are now able to simply input some text whether it be through a keyboard or by speech recognition technology and be granted a result. The emotional well-being of a person can drastically affect their performance of tasks during the day.  </p>
          <p>Replika AI*5 is a chatbot that utilizes NLP to learn more about a user through mutual interaction and, their motto being, a friend who will be there for you, talk, listen, and without judgement 24X7. According to the World Health Organization*6, depression is a common mental disorder that affects an estimated 5% of adults globally – where more women are affected by depression than men. Depression is a matter that needs to be taken seriously and Replika AI aims to contribute to fighting the effort to reduce and defeat depression. Replika is an accessible solution and according to Partap*7, “85% of Replika users find it helpful to ease their anxiety and stress. Simply talking with the app has helped a plethora of users.”, which proves that it is an effective solution that utilizes NLP. Having the Replika chatbot be a free and accessible program for users globally means people have a greater chance of preventing themselves from succumbing to the effects of depression, as a result, may create a slightly more productive society. </p>

          <h3><u>Cyber Security</u></h3>
          <h4><b>What does it do?</b></h4>
          <p>In contemporary times, protecting our personal data has become a prevalent concern in many aspects of life. The application of cyber security brought on by the need to preserve confidentiality has further compelled advancement in related fields. Instances of mass and targeted fraud, intrusion, spam, and cyber harassment have led to unthinkable losses in revenue, trust, and reputation for many large-scale organizations. As a result, large corporations have diverted a large scale of resources into mitigating such issues. The lead organization providing affordable, manageable, and fundamental security services for the past 20 years is IBM Security. IBM’s services have branched out in recent years, leading other organizations to form comparable products and services directed toward individual systems. Some examples include Norton Security, Malwarebytes and AVG, all of which provide basic support in malware prevention, data protection and restoration, ensuring users are not only protected from malicious activity, but to also provide assurance in events of large-scale data loss. Although present day services provide extensive cyber security coverage, the ‘potency’ of cyber-attacks are increasing exponentially to the point that implemented systems are becoming obsolete. Phishing schemes, APT attacks, spyware, targeted hacks have become more common throughout recent years, more notably since the start of the coronavirus pandemic beginning in early 2020. Intuitive solutions in countering malicious threats are being drafted and implemented each day. Artificial intelligence and machine learning advancements have improved in the early detection/prediction of current vulnerabilities and potential future threats. Implementing a ‘zero trust policy’ in many organizations have additionally reduced the risk of data breaches and network intrusion, as many as 70% of large-scale organizations have introduced this policy indefinitely to protect employees, client confidentiality as well as internal workplace data.  </p>
          <p>Further, a sizable portion of cyber security software developers and engineers are looking to introduce adaptive security processes in conjunction with various cyber security software’s, widely used in professional environments. The ‘Adaptive’ approach to cyber security involves the analysis of common behavioral tendencies of the user and cross checking with previously encountered threats in order for a highly sophisticated and complex architecturally relevant algorithm to be formed. This algorithm is highly reflective of Artificial intelligence in that it can predict potential threats and either execute required procedures in order mitigate the problem or provide a detailed report to relevant technical staff in which they can effectively compile a viable solution. Based on Paloaltos Networks list for Cybersecurity Automation, the correlation of data is critical in providing rapid solutions in identifying ‘unknown threats’ inclusive of previously unidentified; infected host systems. The concept of cyber security through automated systems and/or artificial intelligence has been up for further study due to potential flaws within secondary backchecking, target accuracy and most notably, unintentional data wiping which can prove extremely troublesome in elaborate/multi component database systems.  </p>
          <p>Although implementing previously mentioned cyber security systems/services are highly valued in both individual and cooperate settings, a deficiency in available technologies and knowledge is apparent. Applications in cybersecurity via intelligent systems require both skilled expertise understanding machine learning capabilities, programming recognizable features including the reasoning aspects of A.I such as problem solving, resource manipulation with reference to the target cybersecurity requirements and desired outcomes. A wider understanding around elements such as embedded hardware authentication (EHA) is vital in adding further user authentication abilities in respects to providing priority access for designated personnel and in software maintenance. Overall, contemporary technologies in cybersecurity applications are critical in ensuring data privacy, security, and authentication. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud-based systems/servers and various authentical techniques further extend cybersecurity capabilities by highlighting potential flaws or areas for improvement within pre-existing cybersecurity products and services </p>
          <h4><b>What is the likely impact?</b></h4>
          <p>Recent advancements in cybersecurity technologies have demonstrated that the majority of individuals who utilize computer systems; whether it be in a personal or organizational sense, heavily depend upon cybersecurity services and software. Recent developments in implementing automated cybersecurity systems have been showing extremely promising results. These automated systems will increase the users or organizations abilities to detect potential or immediate threats, identify its severity or potential impact on specific operations and quarantine them without the need for human intervention. This can heavily reduce the need for a cumbersome and time-consuming process with addition to increased workplace efficiency. Furthermore, current cybersecurity systems require increased maintenance and resource diversion. Replacing outdated systems with a self-contained and automated variant will undoubtably improve resource management capabilities and heavily alleviate workloads for technical support/analyst units. </p>
          <p>Advanced technological developments in cybersecurity will considerably shift standard workplace practices and improve overall security and safety for many individuals. Large corporations such as Apple, Samsung and Windows follow a strict set of business rules, practices, and arrangements with respect to slight differences. The listed corporations store countless quantities of data some of which are extremely confidential. For this reason, companies heavily rely on various forms of cybersecurity including software, firewalls, and physical embedded hardware authentication elements. Although currently described as ‘sufficient’, cybersecurity threats are becoming more prevalent in recent years. Introducing improved forms of cybersecurity can substantially reduce the risk of data breaches or damaging leaks. Automated cybersecurity systems are being implemented in many industry settings, filtering through large server computers, network properties and cloud servers to identify threats and vanquish each with tactical precision.  </p>
          <p>Many current employment positions require a basic understanding of computer systems and internal functionalities. However, all most all businesses operate with a technical support team who are the most prone to be impacted by workplace change. Introducing automated or self-operating cybersecurity systems may lead to reduced work hours, less application acceptance or in potential cases permeate discharging of technical support members. Although, potential job prospects may be opened in the programming and maintenance operations for the automated cybersecurity systems. </p>
          <h4><b>How will this affect you?</b></h4>
          <p>On a regular basis, I utilize various forms of cybersecurity including: user authentication services, ISP, and IP hiders such as Nord VPN and smaller scale web browser extensions including Malwarebytes and privacy.com. The future of cybersecurity provides a sense of safety in that I feel assured that my confidential information and data remains safe in years to come. The use of automated cybersecurity systems and further improvements in threat detection will surely improve my digital as well as my physical wellbeing and safety. Although extremely confronting to some extent, having my files, passwords, confidential data, and search history monitored automatedly can elevate some stress when it comes to protecting personal information. </p>
          <p>Improvements to the cybersecurity functionalities within my computer system will undoubtably prove to be a useful asset in a professional sense. Being able to keep track of potentially malicious websites, files or unauthorized access can improve your confidence when using the internet or your computing device in general. According to ZDNET, each year approximately “261 billion data records [are] being lost or stolen” every year. Having advanced forms of user authentication, password management and malware identification software can heavily reduce your chances of losing valuable and confidential information,  also protecting your computer from being accessed by malicious hackers’ intent on ruining your digital status. </p>
          <p>Friends and family are extremely important to me as they provide me with comfort and support in times of grief, sadness, or general discontent. Majority of my family is over the age of 40 and have difficulties understanding basic computer functionalities. Recently, one of grandparents fell victim to a fraud scheme which involved a scammer entering their computer and stealing their personal documentation. The lack of cybersecurity on their computer was a key factor in this occurring. The promising developments put forth by developers including automated file filtration systems and authentication services etc., provide hope to struggling elderly or inexperienced individuals in that they confidently use the internet without being afraid of potential scams, data loss or invasion of privacy   </p>

          <h3><u>Cloud Services</u></h3>
          <h4><b>What does it do?</b></h4>
          <p>While clouds, services and servers are three separate technologies, they fall under the same category. Physical servers and the services they provide were the most prominent for many years as they were the only option. These servers are powerful computers, most often stored in data centers for businesses. They help the company by running operating systems and applications off of the relevant internal hardware. One of their biggest drawbacks, in this case, is the fact that each of these setups can only be used by a single tenant, as the resources cannot be distributed.  </p>
          <p>Over the last decade, the world has slowly begun to shift to utilizing cloud computing and servers virtually over the former option. Therefore, there must be some benefits to taking this approach. Cloud servers list a host of advantages in comparison to its counterpart, some of which include reliability, availability, mobility, speed, efficiency, and affordability.  </p>
          <p>Cloud servers take a new approach to storing data and providing services. They instead act as a software-based representation of a physical server, with all data being sent to a virtual space that runs in a cloud computing environment. This allows all information to be accessed online and run as independent units.  </p>
          <p>Cloud computing can be found in many forms, the most important utilization of them for businesses is commonly seen around the world. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) are two fundamental types of this product. IaaS lets consumers purchase infrastructure which can be accessed and utilized online. PaaS is very similar; it offers the same features as IaaS but also the firmware and development tools for selling their services. These two alike allow companies to save on the cost of expensive physical hardware. </p>
          <p>One of the more impactful negatives of physical servers was the complexity of backing up data, and in turn, restoring it if something was to go wrong. Disaster recovery also runs in a similar vein. The benefits of using the Cloud to store, backup and recover data are the cost and time-efficient compared to their previous counterpart.  </p>
          <p>Another important form is the ability to buy and sell big data analytics, this is seen within companies who desire to extract and use information derived from customers and their data. Companies that are usually interested in this form of the Cloud would be social networking platforms or suppliers that wish to learn more about how they should be marketing and advertising.  </p>
          <p>The concept of cloud computing launched around the mid-20th century but only became mainstream in the early 2000s. Since around 2020, most up to date companies will utilise a hybrid of both physical and cloud-based servers. The split will depend on the said company, which can either be equal in usage or skewed more towards all virtual. A 2019 IDC study did however show that physical servers are still an important part of the data center, they just are not receiving the same advancements as their counterpart.  </p>
          <p>The future lies within the services that cloud computing can provide and increase its cost efficiency, performance, and reliability. There is no doubt that the many attributes that makeup cloud computing like its storage capacity, security enhancements or networking speed will see vast increases over the next few years. It is not the real benefactor of this state-of-the-art technology.  However, the disadvantages of the cloud should not be overlooked. Any downtime in network connections will make accessing its services and data very difficult. </p>
          <p>The advancements in virtualization technology are one of the biggest components in making cloud computing what it is today. Virtualization at its core is the ability to let software simulate hardware and create a virtual computer system. Cloud computing is simply one of the consequences of this process.  </p>
          <p>There is no denying that the monetary increases found within the IT industry have also helped to further push and advance cloud computing. Of course, many other technologies helped with this development such as enabling faster broadband internet access, networking infrastructure and increases in storage devices.  </p>
          <h4><b>What is the likely impact?</b></h4>
          <p>The greater impact of cloud computing and servers, in general, is the way that they allow end-users. Empowering businesses and companies to work from anywhere and the hew of other new outlooks it has created. Giving the ability to access these features to not only those who could afford the hardware, but now everyone with an internet connection can access those that were previously inaccessible.  </p>
          <p>For example, in recent years the possibility to stream video games from a cloud computing device onto your own was made possible. This alleviates the lack of expensive hardware that one may have and allows you to stream any game to your device and play it from the cloud. While this is a relative innovation, it still has a long way to go with most of the world’s internet not being able to provide a strong enough connection. The advancements of these streaming services along with developments of the cloud itself will hopefully strengthen the quality of streaming video games without having to spend thousands on a computer itself. The likely changes over the next few years will line up with that above. Changes in performance, cost efficiency, internet speeds and reliability and the likes are more common than any changes in how cloud computing or servers infrastructure work.   </p>
          <p>The reconstruction of servers and the implementation of cloud computing came to fruition. Only a small percentage of the jobs lost in this period were attributed to the cloud. In reality, cloud computing reconfigured the workforce. While it did remove some of the previously required occupations, it also created many new jobs and job opportunities. The short-term negatives are far outweighed by the many big picture positives. Providing people and small businesses with the ability to create start-up businesses and sell their ideas for minimal investment has been a huge addition to the industry. After all, companies that utilise a hybrid of both forms of technology or a majority of physical hardware still need those occupations that were caught in the fire.  </p>
          <h4><b>How will this affect you?</b></h4>
          <p>Cloud computing and the services it provides have affected the average person’s day to day life immensely. It may go unrecognized by some but a large percentage of everyday life activities such as banking, shopping, education, and media streaming services all use the Cloud. Not only does it affect personal endeavors, but cloud computing also runs the business side of many of the world’s most famous industries and workplaces as well.  </p>
          <p>The increase in possibilities for students within the cloud is one of the largest advances in education for a long time. Being able to send, receive and access information from anywhere at any time gives students and teachers the ability to store their data securely without the need for complex and expensive hardware. While most first-world countries did have access to those physical servers and such previously, less developed areas can now reap the same rewards without the need for them.  </p>
          <p>Another daily life advancement cloud storage introduced was the advanced navigational systems seen in modern vehicles. Cloud computing can store such a large amount of data and automatically update it accordingly has allowed the way we drive to be superior to its previous iterations. The cloud also has changed the way people interact with their cars entirely. This is most commonly seen in the plethora of third-party applications like music software, phone calls and payment tools.  </p>
          <p>Unlike some other new technological innovations, the way that Clouds, servers, and services affect us is all the same. It may be utilized differently in some regards and help each person differently. Overall, it helps every category and group of individuals as a whole in the same way. A lot of these advancements are simply a result of evolving previous technology and were possible beforehand. They are now provided us with far greater efficiency, reliability, comfortability, and usability in the way it lets people perform tasks.  </p>
